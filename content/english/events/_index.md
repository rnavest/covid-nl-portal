The [Infectious Diseases Toolkit (IDTk)](https://www.infectious-diseases-toolkit.org/) is a community effort to expose best practices and showcase solutions to data challenges affecting the response to infectious diseases outbreaks. It was created as part of the [BY-COVID project](https://by-covid.org/).

This resource contains information specific for the management of infectious disease data. Specifically, it includes information about management at every part of the data lifecycle for data related to [pathogen characterisation](https://www.infectious-diseases-toolkit.org/pathogen-characterisation/), [socioeconomic data](https://www.infectious-diseases-toolkit.org/socioeconomic-data/), [human biomolecular data](https://www.infectious-diseases-toolkit.org/human-biomolecular-data/), and [human clinical and health data](https://www.infectious-diseases-toolkit.org/human-clinical-and-health-data/).

Information is available specifically about the [resources related to infectious disease in the Netherlands](https://www.infectious-diseases-toolkit.org/national-resources/netherlands).

The [ELIXIR Research Data Management Kit (RDMkit)](https://rdmkit.elixir-europe.org/) is an online guide containing good data management practices applicable to research projects from the beginning to the end. Developed and managed by people who work every day with life science data, the RDMkit has guidelines, information, and pointers to help you with problems throughout the data’s life cycle. RDMkit supports FAIR data — Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable — by-design, from the first steps of data management planning to the final steps of depositing data in public archives.

Information is organised by role (e.g. researcher, data steward), scientific domain (e.g. proteomics, human data, bioimaging data), tasks (e.g. data analysis, data management plan, licensing).

Information is specifically available for [research data management in the Netherlands](https://rdmkit.elixir-europe.org/nl_resources).

### Other

This section includes conferences, webinars, workshops, and training opportunities related to pandemic preparedness and infectious disease. This includes events related to the management of data for these topics. We also welcome suggestions for events related to research data management in general.
